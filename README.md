# My readme page in Markdown

This is **Markdown**. You [create a link](http://carlapedret.github.io/test/) by putting square brackets around the words to be linked, followed immediately by normal parentheses containing the URL to be linked to.

Bullet lists use an asterisk at the start of the line followed by a space like so:

* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2

> A greater than operator will create an indent at the start of the line. Multiple greater than operators will create bigger indents.

`this will make stuff look like code`
